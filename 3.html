<h1> JavaScripts </h1>
<p> avaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/),[10] 
often abbreviated to JS, 
is a programming language 
that is one of the core technologies 
of the World Wide Web, 
alongside HTML and CSS.[11] As of 2022, 
98% of websites use JavaScript on the client 
side for webpage behavior,[12] 
often incorporating third-party libraries.
 All major web browsers have a dedicated 
 JavaScript engine to execute the code 
 on users' devices.
